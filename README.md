# CRUDLingo

## Project Description
CRUDLingo is an innovative **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** based querying system designed to perform **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a **NoSQL database(MongoDB)**. The project leverages advanced AI and machine learning techniques, including the **DistilBERT** model, which has been fine-tuned to classify intents, collections, databases, and attributes.

The core of CRUDLingo integrates **blockchain technology** to maintain a secure and immutable history of all operations performed on the database. This not only ensures transparency and accountability but also allows users to revert to previous states of the database, providing a robust mechanism for data integrity and recovery. Also,users can share access to the database without disclosing the private connection string.

## Key Features
- **NLP-Based Querying**: Utilizes the **DistilBERT** model fine-tuned for intent, collection, database, and attribute classification to interpret and execute natural language queries. 🧠
- **Gemini API Integration**: Enhances classification accuracy and assists in understanding complex queries. 🌟
- **Blockchain Integration**: Stores a tamper-proof history of all database operations, enabling users to track changes and revert to previous states. 🔗
- **NoSQL Database Support**: Designed to work seamlessly with NoSQL databases, providing flexibility and scalability. 🗃️
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with **NEXTJS**, offering an intuitive and responsive user interface for interacting with the system. 💻

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend and Backend**: NEXTJS 🌐
- **AI/ML**: DistilBERT, Python 🤖
- **Blockchain**: Custom blockchain implementation for operation history and state management 🛠️
